# VoxelEngine
Simple voxel based graphics engine

This is a bare bones, unoptimized, work in progress.

It is also a simple voxel based graphics engine suitable for the creation of a game in the same vein as minecraft or similar.  Built in vanilla C++, using the GLEW and GLFW libraries for windows.  Since the old repo crasahed and burned, the build files are not included, and as this is a WIP, no timeframe is available for their production.
